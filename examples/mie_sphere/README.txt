Scripts used to reproduce the performance test results of the manuscript: An ultra-thin boundary layer for high-accuracy simulations of light propagation

------------------

First run mie_sphere_analytical_solution.m to obtain analytical results. 
Then run mie_sphere_test to obtain the wavesim results

------------------

Note: This script makes use of the external matlab code package 'MatScat' to obtain the analytical solution.
This Matlab package can be found at: mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36831-matscat
