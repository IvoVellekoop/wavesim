MatScat is a MATLAB package which contains different solutions for the
scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a sphere (Mie theory) or an
infinite circular cylinder. Most of the code has been developed during my PhD
work [3]. The multiple cylinder near field solution has been implemented
afterwards and has been presented in a seperate publication [4].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that the root folder and the folders  '/bessel', '/expcoeff' and 
'/util' are in the Matlab-Path. The files in '/test' can be run to check if 
everything works fine.  

The functions to start the calculation can be found in the root folder.
These are:

calccyl.m - calculate the far field solution for a single (stratified) cylinder
calccyl_nf.m - calculate the near field solution for a single (stratified) cylinder
calccyl_multi.m - calculate the far field solution for multiple cylinders
calccyl_multi_nf.m - calculate the near field solution for multiple cylinders
calcmie.m - calculate the far field solution for a single (stratified) sphere 
calcmie_nf.m - calculate the near field solution for a single (stratified) sphere

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use these functions in your research work please cite my work [3,4].
Please also cite the theoretical work underlying my implementation which is:
calccyl, calccyl_nf, calcmie and calcmie_nf are implemented based on [1].
calccyl_multi and calccyl_multi_nf are implemented based on [2,4].
The stratified cylinder/sphere solution is implemented based on [1,5].
